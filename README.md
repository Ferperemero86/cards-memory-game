 # cards-memory-game

 1.HOW IT WORKS

 You have 16 cards turned down, time and a score that depends on the movements you need in order to win the game.

 Click 2 different cards in order to see their content  and see if they match. If they match they will appear in a different color and

 permanently showing their content. If not they will go to their original position.

 You need to match all the cards in order to win the game with the less movements possible in order to get the best score possible.

 The best score possible is 3 stars  and the worse 1 star.

 GOOD LUCK!!
